A junior developer at Trayport has built a tool for clients to calculate their market position at the end of the day.

The story says:
"As a client, I would like to be able to view my market position for a single day using a trade log file (produced by another program, which is unlikely to change), so that I know how much I've bought and sold throughout the day for each trading instrument"

Your task is:
- report & fix any bugs you find
- refactor the implementation into clean, elegant, rock-solid & well performing code, without over-engineering.
- for any changes/improvements, comment and explain why 
- ensure the tool is suitable for clients
- if you would like to use visual studio, a variety of free options are here: http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/

Please zip up your solution and send us back your code and/or documents. They may come into play at a later stage in the interview process.
